Going to define 3 functions:

1) Find Titan's current orbital plane
2) Calculate the Delta V to get into an assumed Saturn orbit
3) Calculate the lambert function from Saturn to Titan from a point in the orbit

What do I need:
1) the specific Saturn orbit we are trying for
2) Assume we do one orbit of Saturn, and then burn to Titan (so calculate how long one orbit of Saturn would be)

First attempt:
Assume we are in the same inclination plane, and calculate the lambert required
Eccentricity coming out is way too large (many there are some different units being used?)
